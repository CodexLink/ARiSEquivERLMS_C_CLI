## Welcome!
Enrollment System for C CLI (No Brand) was one of our first project in programming that only circulates in C Language. Our goal is to make a responsive application that technically able to replicate a Web application / system called "ARIS". ARIS is one our school web system that currently operates within the school. With that, alternatives can be done just in case, and so this application was born.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Here are the things that you need to install the software. Each software has labelled it's difficulty on how to use it.

```
PROGRAM NAME - COMMENTS - SET UP DIFFICULTY

IDE (Dependent and Independent)

Visual Studio Code (Dependent IDE) - For Coding w/o Compiling - Easy, w/ Compiling + Dependencies - Hard
Dev-C++ - Obsolete Alternative IDE for Compiling - Easy
Visual Studio (Community Edition) - Accurate Checks with Quality, Large Size IDE - (For Setting up Options) - Intermediate

TOOLS & Visual Studio Code Dependencies

Cppcheck - Checker for C and C++ Code - Easy
C / C++ Components
Beautify
Terminal
Code Runner - Alternative Compiler - (First Time Setup) - Between Medium and Hard

Collaboration
VS Live Share - You need aspiring or willing groupmates to use this one.
Github Desktop, Git GUI and Git Bash - Alternative Collaboration Than Usual File Passing - Intermediate

```

## Deployment

Just run the your-compiled version of this program and that was it. No additional steps required. User cannot change things on database...

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The primary text editor with Github Integration and other such stuffs. Secondary Compiler and Debugger.
* [Dev C++](http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html) - The secondary text editor for compiling with GCC, integrated to CMD.
* [CppCheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) - Cppcheck is a static code analysis tool for the C and C++ programming languages.
* [Visual Studio Code Extension - Code Runner](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) - A Visual Studio Code Extension used to easily build the program.
* [Windows API / Win32API / Visual C / C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/apiindex/windows-api-list) - A C / C++ Library API used to initialize / manipulate functions and windows and other such stuffs from Windows OS.
* [Win32 Port of OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH) - Win32 port of OpenSSH.

## Contributing

There is no contribution outside for a moment. I'm planning to work on this part.

## Versioning

We use don't use any APIs regarding software version. But instead we usually do based on time and date in 24H format. For example:
```
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 1651-082118.BETA
```
Beta is state of a program that is very unstable point.
We are planning to automatically do basic versioning with C Language soon. Not so complex but far more basic.
