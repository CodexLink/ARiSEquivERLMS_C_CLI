# Introduction / Information
This project was one of our first project in programming that only circulates in C Language. Our goal is to make a responsive application that technically able to replicate a Web application / system called "Aris". Aris is one of the school web system that currently operates. With that, alternative can be done just in case.

### Technical Description

It contains logical-complex functions or simple assignment task.
# External Libraries Used
- Win32API (Visual C)
- Library XLSXWriter for C

# Why would you like to distribute this?
I want to distribute this in a way of helping people with a twist. Also this wasn't really meant to be shared in public. It was used to collaborate with people. Other than that, this repository will be hardened at some point.

# Disclaimer
We want to be good as possible, but as far as we know, this project will likely to be shared by everyone else without any credit. With that, soon enough we will try to hard coded this.
