# Introduction / Information
This project was one of our first project in programming that only circulates in C Language. Our goal is to make a responsive application that technically able to replicate a Web application / system called "Aris". Aris is one of the school web system that currently operates. With that, alternative can be done just in case.

### Technical Description
This is a C Language that contains a lots of libraries to be used. Other than that, basic syntax and commandws can be made within the project. No other such high level or mid level programming style can be done due to the limitations of our knowledge in C Programming.

# Libraries Used with Links
- Win32API

# Why would you like to distribute this?
I want to distribute this in a way of helping people with a twist. Also this wasn't really meant to be shared in public. It was used
to collaborate with people. Other than that,

# Disclaimer
We want to be good as possible, but as far as we know, this project will likely to be shared by everyone else without any credit. With that, soon enough we will try to hard coded this.
