<h1 align="center">ARiS Basic Equivalent Enrollment System in C CLI</h1>
<h5 align="center">A First Year College 1st Semester Programming Project in CPE 007 | Programming Logic and Design. Enrollment System Alternative for Offline Situation, Made in C CLI with Win32API Mix</h5>

## Welcome / Introduction

Enrollment System for C CLI for this specific matter was one of our first projects in programming that only revolves around in C Language. Our goal is to make a console application that could potentially be reusable as a secondary application to which replicate a Web application / system called "ARIS". ARIS is one our school web systems that currently operates within the school. With that, alternatives can be done just in case, and so this application was born.

## Development Notice

This part of the repository will now be categorized as `Deprecated`. Because, the ability to code to C is quite impossible as I always code in C++ at any time. Many limitations will halt me at doing something that I like, such as, creating a class. If you're looking for the Last State Stable, well this is the branch you're looking for. (This might get updated once the work is done in PostWork Branch) The PostWork Branch will refactor this project in C++ along with Win32API and MySQL + OpenSSH.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Here are the things that you need to install the software. Each software labeled contains small information to know more about it.

### IDE

- Visual Studio Code (Dependent IDE) - Primary Coding Editor. Used for personal preference.
- Dev-C++ - Obsolete Alternative IDE for Compiling - Used during early-stage development.
- Visual Studio 2016 (Community Edition) - Used during late-stage development as we are starting to require Win32 APIs for SetConsoleTitle function.

### TOOLS & Visual Studio Code Dependencies

- Cppcheck - Checker for C and C++ Code - Easy
- C / C++ Components
- Beautify
- Terminal
- Code Runner - Alternative Compiler - (First Time Setup) - Used during middle-stage development.

### Collaboration Tools

VS Live Share - ***You need aspiring or willing groupmates to use this one.***
Github Desktop, Git GUI and Git Bash - File Version Control.

## Deployment

Keep in mind that, you shouldn't try to run t he program under VSCode after you compile it. You could compile it but after that, terminate the program and launch it seperately. VSCode launches the program under Integrated Terminal and that would occur unexpected views.

Just run `ERLM_ARiS_SourceCore.c` and that was it. No additional steps required.


## Built With

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The primary text editor with Github Integration and other such stuffs. Secondary Compiler and Debugger.
- [Dev C++](http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html) - The secondary text editor for compiling with GCC, integrated to CMD.
- [CppCheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) - Cppcheck is a static code analysis tool for the C and C++ programming languages.
- [Visual Studio Code Extension - Code Runner](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner) - A Visual Studio Code Extension used to easily build the program.
- [Windows API / Win32API / Visual C / C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/apiindex/windows-api-list) - A C / C++ Library API used to initialize / manipulate functions and windows and other such stuffs from Windows OS.
- [Win32 Port of OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH) - Win32 port of OpenSSH.

## Versioning

We use don't use any Semantic Versioning APIs regarding software versioning. But instead we do based on time and date in 24H format. For example:

```text
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: 1651-082118.BETA
```
