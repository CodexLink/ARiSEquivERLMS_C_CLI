## Welcome / Introduction

Enrollment System for C CLI for this specific matter was one of our first projects in programming that only revolves around in C Language. Our goal is to make a console application that could potentially be reusable as a secondary application to which replicate a Web application / system called "ARIS". ARIS is one our school web systems that currently operates within the school. With that, alternatives can be done just in case, and so this application was born.

## Development Notice

This part of the repository will be the latest version. I wanna refactor this one out because it keeps bothering me that tells me exactly that I don't want to keep obfuscated code. So we should be moving slowly because we're trying to keep our selves cornered by a lot of pending projects. So we need to add one more which is this one. There will be a lot of implementation to do so because there are lots of things that are left out and ideas were disposed because of the impossibility of working it since I worked on this one alone and never explored even further just like using SQLite for this one. But we have an idea that I should be implementing since I have done a lot since for a while.

Anyhow, the ***development of this repository will be slow as expected***. But rest assured, I'm going to do something about it.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Here are the things that you need to install the software. Each software labeled contains small information to know more about it.

### IDE

- Visual Studio Code (Dependent IDE) - Primary Coding Editor. Used for personal preference.
- Visual Studio 201(6/9) Build Tools (Community Edition) ... - Might use this one to compile with MySQL DLL Binaries.

### TOOLS & Visual Studio Code Dependencies

- C / C++ Extension
- Beautify

## Deployment

Coming Soon.

## Built With

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The primary text editor with Github Integration and other such stuffs. Secondary Compiler and Debugger.
- [Windows API / Win32API / Visual C / C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/apiindex/windows-api-list) - A C / C++ Library API used to initialize / manipulate functions and windows and other such stuffs from Windows OS.
- [Win32 Port of OpenSSH](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH) - Win32 port of OpenSSH.
- MySQL

## Versioning

We use don't use any Semantic Versioning APIs regarding software versioning. But instead we do based on time and date in 24H format. For example:

```text
When Build is done: at 4:51 PM at 08/21/2018
Result Versioning is: (Post|Beta).1651-082118
```
